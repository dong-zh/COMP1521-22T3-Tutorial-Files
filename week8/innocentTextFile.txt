Among Us[c] is a 2018 online multiplayer social deduction game developed and published by American game studio Innersloth. The game was inspired by the party game Mafia and the science fiction horror film The Thing. The game allows for cross-platform play, first being released on iOS and Android devices in June 2018 and on Windows later that year in November. The game was then ported to the Nintendo Switch in December 2020, and on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S in December 2021. While the game was initially released in 2018 to little mainstream attention, it received a massive influx of popularity in 2020 due to many well-known Twitch streamers and YouTubers playing it. A separate VR version of the game, Among Us VR, will be released for Quest 2, SteamVR, and PlayStation VR, developed by Schell Games.

Among Us takes place in a space-themed setting where players look like colorful armless cartoon astronauts; however, since the release of "The Skeld" spaceship, three other maps have been added in later years: the skyscraper "MIRA HQ", the "Polus" planetary station, and "The Airship" (based on Infiltrating the Airship from the Henry Stickmin series, also developed by Innersloth). Each player takes on one of two roles—most are Crewmates, but a small number play Impostors—which does not alter their appearance.[d] The goal of the Crewmates is to either identify and vote out the Impostors, or to complete all the tasks around the map; the goal of the Impostors is to covertly sabotage the mission either by killing the Crewmates before they complete all their tasks or by triggering a disaster that cannot be resolved.

Gameplay
A white-suited astronaut named "Buddy" (the player) stands in front of an unnamed blue-suited corpse. The room they are in is labeled "Admin". In the hallway, slightly obscured by the sight line mechanic, is a pink-suited astronaut named "Chum". In the upper-left corner of the player's screen, there is a fake list of tasks as well as the player's goal: to kill all Crewmates. The player also has the option to Use, Report, Sabotage, and Kill. As the player has just killed, the button is on cooldown and faded.
In this gameplay screenshot of the original map, The Skeld, the white Impostor has just killed the blue Crewmate in the centrally located Admin room. Because of the vision mechanic for Among Us, the pink player is partially obscured in the white player's field of vision. Any player can report the dead body and trigger a meeting.
Among Us is a multiplayer game for four to fifteen players (previously four to ten players), although recommended for at least five.[11] Up to three players are randomly[12] and secretly chosen to be the Impostor(s) each round. As of 2021, a round can take place on one of four maps: a spaceship called "The Skeld"; a headquarters building called "MIRA HQ"; a planet base called "Polus";[13] or an airship based on Innersloth's Henry Stickmin series called "The Airship".[14][15]

The Impostor(s) win(s) one of two ways: either by killing most of the crew (to the point that they're equal in number) or by sabotaging a critical system on the map (provided the Crewmates don't resolve it in time). The Crewmates likewise can win one of two ways: either by completing all tasks or by identifying and ejecting all Impostors.[13] Games can also end by players quitting the match if doing so fulfills any win condition (if a Crewmate quits the game, their tasks are automatically considered completed).[16][17][18]

At the start of the game, Crewmates are assigned "tasks" to complete around the map (in the form of minigames, minipuzzles, and simple toggles), mostly consisting of maintenance work on vital systems such as fixing wires and downloading data.[19] Impostors are given a fake list of suggested tasks to blend in with Crewmates. However, they cannot legitimately perform tasks and can only pretend to be doing any of the tasks on the ship. Impostors, however, can sabotage vital systems (such as The Skeld's oxygen supply), close the doors to rooms, quickly and covertly travel through the ventilation system (commonly referred to as "venting"), and kill Crewmates when standing near them. To help the Crewmates identify Impostors, there are various surveillance systems on each map, such as security cameras and an admin system on The Skeld,[20] a doorlog system with sensors in MIRA HQ,[21] and a vitals indicator in Polus.[13] Crewmates may also confirm their identity through "visual tasks" (tasks that have animations which play for other players), which cannot be faked by Impostors.[22]

If a Crewmate is killed or any player is voted out and ejected, they become a ghost. Ghosts can pass through walls, watch other players' activities, and see and chat with other ghosts.[18] Living players have a limited cone of vision;[23] ghosts do not.[24] Moreover, ghosts cannot communicate with living players or be seen by them. Ghosts help their living teammates by completing their tasks (as a Crewmate) or performing various acts of sabotage (as an Impostor).[13]

Any living player may call a group meeting by reporting a dead body, or by pressing the Emergency Meeting button on the map at any time (except during major sabotages, when Emergency Meetings cannot be called, but dead bodies can still be reported).[18][25][26] During a meeting, players discuss who they believe is an Impostor based on the available evidence. Impostors can be identified beyond all reasonable doubt if they are seen venting or killing. A player may be suspected for many other reasons though. However, all the players form a sort of jury and must weigh the veracity or value of each other's statements and questions during the meeting. A plurality vote is held, and if a plurality is obtained, the player whom the most crewmates voted is ejected from the map and they become a ghost, unless the majority of the crewmates choose to skip vote or there is a tie vote.[19][18] Players can communicate in a built-in text chat (with some predefined phrases for phone users),[19] but only during meetings, and only if they are alive (though ghosts can speak with one another at any time).[13][18][23] While the game does not have a built-in voice chat system, it is common for players to use external programs such as Discord,[27][28][29] or to converse regularly if they are in close physical proximity to one another. In case players can hear each other's voices, the game reminds them to not speak except during meetings.

In November 2021, additional roles were made available to players extending beyond the standard Crewmate or Impostor roles. Crewmates can also be Engineers, Scientists, or Guardian Angels. Engineers allow Crewmates to travel through vents like Impostors can, albeit to a limited capacity. Scientists can check vitals at any time to see if any player has been killed recently. Crewmates who become Ghosts can become Guardian Angels, which can temporarily protect living players from being killed. Impostors likewise can be Shapeshifters, allowing them to temporarily morph into other players.

In each game's lobby, various options can be adjusted to customize aspects of gameplay, such as player movement speed, the allowed number of emergency meetings, number of tasks, if there will be "visual tasks",[30] or whether or not an Impostor is revealed after being voted off.[31] There are also many cosmetic options, including spacesuit colors, skins, hats, and pets,[32][33] some of which are paid downloadable content.[e][5][7][23]

Among Us was inspired by the live party game Mafia,[5][35] and the science fiction horror film The Thing.[36] The idea for the concept was originally given by Marcus Bromander, co-founder of Innersloth, who had played Mafia since he was a kid. In the original game, function cards were dealt and players wandered around a house, aimlessly, while another person secretly killed the players, drawing a finger around their neck. Most of its mechanics were still present in Among Us, but the team wanted to "alleviate the need to create an interesting home model and have someone wandering around in a boring environment". So, they decided that the game would be space themed and also added tasks, which, according to Forest Willard, programmer at Innersloth, "changed several times during development".[36][37]

Development began in November 2017.[37] The game was initially intended to be a mobile-only local multiplayer game with a single map.[38] Bromander paused development on Innersloth's other game, The Henry Stickmin Collection, in order to build Among Us' first map, The Skeld.[39] When they began developing the first map, they intended that the ship was always in crisis and that the Impostors could do tasks. However, they found this setup "stressful" and decided that it "[wouldn't leave] much time for detective work and informed meeting conversations".[36][37] Willard described playtesting as painful and frustrating, as the game would break down during sessions forcing him to send playtesters new builds off of Google Play. The team tested the game with 8 of their friends and never tested the game with 9 or the maximum of 10 players.[39] The game was developed using the Unity engine.[40]

The game was released in June 2018 to Android and iOS under the AppID of "spacemafia".[5][41] Shortly after release, Among Us had an average player count of 30 to 50 concurrent players.[30] Bromander blamed the game's poor release on Innersloth being "really bad at marketing".[38] The team nearly abandoned the project multiple times, but continued work on it due to a "small but vocal player base",[42] adding in online multiplayer, new tasks, and customization options.[42] The game was released on Steam on November 16, 2018.[38][43] Cross-platform play was supported upon release of the Steam version.[44][45] Originally, the game had no audio to avoid revealing hidden information in a local setting,[f] and Willard mixed sounds from numerous sound packs to compose the SFX during the game's Steam release.[39]

On August 8, 2019, Innersloth released a second map, MIRA HQ,[46][47] a "tightly packed headquarters roughly the size of The Skeld." A third map, Polus, was added on November 12, 2019, and is set in a research station.[46][48] The fourth map, the Airship, was released on March 31, 2021, and is based on a location in the Henry Stickmin universe.[14][15] MIRA HQ and Polus originally cost players US$4 via in-app purchase. Their prices were reduced to US$2 on January 6, 2020, then made free on June 11, 2020.[49] While the map packs are still available for purchase on all platforms, they now only provide the player the skins that were bundled with the maps.[50] According to programmer Forest Willard, the team "stuck with [the game] a lot longer than we probably should have from a pure business standpoint", putting out regular updates to the game as often as once per week. This led to a steady increase in players, causing the game's player base to snowball. Bromander attributed this to the studio having enough savings to keep working on the game even while it was not selling particularly well.[38]

Canceled sequel and ongoing updates
In August 2020, the team shifted focus onto a sequel, Among Us 2.[6][7][8][9] During this time, Forest Willard and Amy Liu continued to update Among Us, increasing the maximum player base, adding four servers and three regions,[51] and implementing longer multiplayer codes to support more concurrent games.[52] On September 23, 2020, the team canceled the sequel, instead opting to add all content intended for the sequel to the original Among Us, due to "how many people [were] enjoying [the original game]".[53][54][55] However, Innersloth deemed the game's codebase "outdated and not built to support adding so much new content", so the team made plans to rework the game's core code to enable adding new features.[55] The team subsequently announced their plans to fix the game's server issues and widespread cheating problem,[56][57][58] as well as add a system for banning disruptive players.[59] In October 2020, colorblind support for the "wires" task was added to the Among Us beta on Steam, as well as some previously unannounced lobby customization options.[60][61] As-of-yet unimplemented features include improving gameplay for ghosts,[62] adding customizable controls,[63] a friends system, a fifth map, and new game modes.[53][54][59][64][65]

In mid-February 2021, the game added a feature called Quickchat, which replaces the standard chat interface with a series of preset phrases that players must pick from. Players under the age of 13 are required to use Quickchat, but those over 13 are also allowed to use Free Chat, which allows them to type original messages.[66][67] First announced at The Game Awards 2020, the Airship map was released on March 31, 2021.[14][15] The Airship features multiple floors, contraptions, tasks, and "more".[68][69] In addition, Game Awards presenter Geoff Keighley's face was added as a skin. The map itself is based upon the Henry Stickmin series's Toppat Clan Airship.[70] Innersloth also stated that the map would be free to all players.[71][15] It also features a skin bundle that includes Henry Stickmin-themed cosmetic that can be bought on Steam.[15]

The accounts system was implemented along with the update, and it allows players to report players that are not following Innersloth' Code of Conduct in order to make the game a welcoming and respectful place. Punishment ranges from temporary to a permanent ban. They also stated that reports would be viewed manually and not by bots, that account creations would be required if players want to use Free Chat or to customize their nicknames, and that people under the age of 13 would need their parents' permission to create an account. A friends system and the ability to link to multiple accounts would be added somewhere in the future.[72][73] Innersloth later revealed on the game's official Twitter account a new color to the game, Rose, which was included in the game's next update along with five other colors: Coral, Tan, Gray, Maroon, and Banana, which were revealed during Summer Game Fest on June 10, 2021, alongside other upcoming content, including a fifth map, new Hide & Seek game mode, and new roles such as Sheriff and Scientist.[64][65] The new colors, along with 15 player lobby support, new meeting screen and revamp at the game's design, was released on June 15, 2021, during the game's 3rd anniversary.[11]

On July 7, 2021, Innersloth released a minor update that adds a new task, "Clean Vent", which involves the Crewmate cleaning a specific vent, preventing Impostors from using it.[74] On November 9, a major update was released that introduced four new roles, achievements, a level system, and an in-game store.[75] During The Game Awards 2021, Among Us VR was announced for SteamVR, PlayStation VR, and the Meta Quest 2, developed by Schell Games.[76]

Console releases
Amid its popularity, Innersloth considered releasing the game to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles, but encountered a problem in implementing player communication, since standard text-based or voice-based chat seemed unusable. They considered a system similar to the "quick comms" system from Rocket League, as well as the possibility of developing an entirely new communication system for the game.[27][28] Versions of the game for Xbox consoles were later announced.[77]

Among Us was released for the Nintendo Switch on December 15, 2020, the same day it was announced during Nintendo Direct Indie World showcase. The Switch version supports cross-platform play with the mobile and Windows versions.[78] This port was published by Play EveryWare.[79] Upon release, the Switch version had an exploit to access The Airship prior to its official release in early 2021.[80] The exploit was fixed two days after release in the Switch version's first update.[81][82] Currently, all the game's downloadable content is unavailable on Switch, although the team stated that it will be added in some point.[83]

Among Us was released digitally for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S consoles on December 14, 2021, along with its release on the Xbox Game Pass for console. These versions will support cross-platform play with existing Windows, Switch, and mobile versions. Unique to the PlayStation ports are special customization options based on Ratchet & Clank. Physical releases for consoles will be available in Europe the same day, while North American physical releases will be available in January 2022.[84]

October 2020 and January 2021 hacks
In mid-October 2020, a hacker known as "Eris Loris" began targeting mainly North American servers. Several players on the Among Us subreddit and Twitter reported this player hacking their lobbies and spamming in-game chat with promotions for his YouTube channel, links to his Discord server, and controversial political messages.[85] Eris Loris also threatened to personally hack players that refused to subscribe to his YouTube channel. The Discord server has been found to contain large amounts of offensive content, such as racist language, gore, pornography and images depicting animal abuse.[86]

A Eurogamer report from October 23, 2020, features an interview with a person claiming to be Eris Loris, conducted via the Discord server from one of the links provided in the hacked games. In the interview, Loris claims he created the bot responsible for the hacks "in only six hours", and had enlisted up to 50 volunteers to form a botnet which boosted the strength of their attacks. Loris claimed that the hack impacted 4.9 million players in 1.5 million games. He also added that the hacks were part of a publicity stunt to influence players to vote for Donald Trump in the 2020 United States presidential election.[86]

Innersloth added an in-game message warning players about the hacks on October 22,[86] and released a statement on Twitter the next day. They said they were "super aware" of the hacking issue, and stated that an "emergency server update" would be pushed out to combat the hacks. They encouraged players to stick to private games and to avoid playing on public ones until the update was released.[87] The team plans to address the hacking vulnerabilities as part of a planned overhaul for the game.[56][57][58] At the end of January 2021, players reported on Twitter the return of Eris Loris' hack attack, which is now distributing Among Us cheats.[88]

Popularity
2020 spike

Streamer Sodapoppin is credited with popularizing Among Us on the live-streaming platform Twitch.
While Among Us released in 2018, it was not until mid-2020 that it saw a surge of popularity, initially driven by content creators online in South Korea and Brazil. Bromander stated that the game is more popular in Mexico, Brazil, and South Korea than the United States.[38][5] According to Willard, Twitch streamer Sodapoppin first popularized the game on Twitch in July 2020.[38] Many other Twitch streamers and YouTubers followed suit, including prominent content creators xQc, Pokimane, Shroud, Ninja, Disguised Toast and PewDiePie.[54][89][35][90]

The COVID-19 pandemic was frequently cited as a reason for the popularity of Among Us, as it allowed for socializing despite social distancing.[38][91][92][93][94] Emma Kent of Eurogamer believed that the release of Innersloth's The Henry Stickmin Collection also contributed to awareness of Among Us,[54] and PC Gamer's Wes Fenlon credited Twitch streamer SR_Kaif for "prim[ing] Among Us for its big moment." Fenlon also praised Among Us for improvements over other popular tabletop games that had been inspired by Mafia, such as Secret Hitler. He said other video game adaptation of Mafia such as Town of Salem and Werewolves Within were "just add[ing] an online interface for the basic Werewolf rules," whereas Among Us is as an entirely new take on the concept.[35] Along with Fall Guys and the Jackbox Party Packs, Among Us provided a narrative-less experience that helped to avoid the "cultural trauma" of the pandemic, according to M.J. Lewis of Wired.[95]

Memes and mods
The game's popularity continued into the following months. YouTube reported that videos about Among Us were viewed 4 billion times in September 2020,[96] and TikTok videos related to Among Us had over 13 billion views in October 2020.[97] YouTuber CG5 wrote a song based on the game in September 2020, titled "Show Yourself", and gained over 60 million views in four months.[98] [g] In September 2020, the game exceeded 100 million downloads[35] and its player count rose to 1.5 million concurrent players[4][99] (nearly 400 thousand of which were on Steam),[46] then peaked at 3.8 million in late September.[100] The sudden increase in players overloaded the game's server, which according to Willard was "a totally free Amazon server, and it was terrible." This forced him to work quickly, under crunch time, to resolve these issues.[42]

In August, Innersloth opened an online store for Among Us themed merchandise.[7][30] The game's popularity inspired many original songs, fanarts and internet memes,[20][25][42] Willard expressed that fan-created content "really is the best part" of making Among Us, and Bromander called it "my favorite thing to see".[42] The game popularized the slang word "sus" (meaning "suspicious" or "suspect"),[101][102][103] which had been used before the game's release.[104] Other slang terms as well as internet memes popularized and inspired by Among Us include 'Sussy' and 'Sussy Baka' (derived from "sus"),[105][106] 'When the Imposter is Sus' (an ironic meme based on Among Us, usually alongside an edited photo of Jerma985),[107] and 'Amogus' (satiric misspelling of "Among Us").[108][109]

During its time of widespread popularity, Among Us was controversially played by the U.S. Navy Esports team, in which players on the stream used in-game names referencing the N-word and the bombing of Nagasaki. The stream was deemed "offensive" and "intolerable" by some viewers.[110] In October 2020, U.S. Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar streamed the game alongside several other prominent streamers such as Pokimane and Hasan Piker as a way to encourage people to vote in the 2020 United States presidential election, drawing almost 700,000 concurrent viewers on Twitch.[111][112][113]

The game also received several mods made by the community, which added new roles, game modes, cosmetics, etc.[114] Among Us was also featured in Twitch Rivals 2020, an online gaming tournament which was held on December 4, 2020.[115] During the event, players were able to receive an exclusive pet called "Glitch Pet", which is the Twitch logo.[116]

Manga
On December 28, 2021, H2 Interactive, who publishes Among Us in Japan, announced that a one-shot manga based on the game will be published in Bessatsu CoroCoro's April issue on February 28, 2022.[117][118] On January 13, Innersloth began promoting the manga on their official Twitter account.[119]

Among Us was well received by critics. On the aggregator website Metacritic, the PC port received a 85 of 100 score based on 9 critic reviews, while the Nintendo Switch version received a 79 of 100 score based on 9 critic reviews, both them indicating "generally favorable reviews".[120][121] It was also considered one of the "Best PC Games for 2018", being ranked 17th, and as the "#38 Best Discussed PC Game of 2018".[129][130] Since December 2020, IGN considered it one of 2020's best reviewed games so far.[131]

Elliott Osange of Bonus Stage considered that the game is "silly fun", but felt that is more fun "to be an Impostor".[132] Craig Pearson of Rock, Paper, Shotgun had the same opinion, found playing as an Impostor "a lot more fun" than playing as a Crewmate, which he called "exhausting".[19] In reference to the game's popularity among streamers, Evelyn Lau of The National said: "Watching the reactions of people trying to guess who the impostor is (and sometimes getting it very wrong) or lying terribly about not being the impostor is all quite entertaining."[18] Alice O'Conner of Rock, Paper, Shotgun described the game as "Mafia or Werewolf but with minigames".[133] Andrew Penney of TheGamer said the game was "worth it for the price" and that "who you play with dictates how fun the game is."[23] L'avis de Tiraxa of Jeuxvideo.com praised the game's Freeplay mode, which offers newer players "to browse the map alone to accommodate the places", as they would need to play several games in order to "perfect their strategies".[124]

Leana Hafer from IGN stated in her verdict on the game: "I don't have any sus that this will be the last game of its breed to make a splash, since we’re already seeing its influence on even mega-games like Fortnite". As a negative point, she pointed out some technical problems, such as the difficulty of finding rooms that aren't already full or are a long way from getting there. She also lamented the lack of "mechanic to punish players who rage-quit when they don't get to play as impostor, or are caught dead to rights in the middle of a murder".[125] Tiraxa of Jeuxvideo.com was more critical of the game, lamenting the lack of an inbuilt voice chat, server bugs which "[prevent] some from joining the party, in a totally unexplained way", public servers with strangers, which she considered "less entertaining" than private servers with friends, and the large development progress, stating that the game has a "bit of a way to go before it reaches its full potential".[124] The mobile version of the game, although being free-to-play, was criticized. Osange of Bonus Stage called the presence of ads and in-app purchases of cosmetic changes that are mostly available for free on the PC version "nonsense". He also called the PC version "stable" but also stated that the Android version is "a device-by-device situation".[132]

The Nintendo Switch version received some criticism. William Antonieli of Insider said that the Switch controls give "many tasks a satisfying game response". However, he also stated that most of the tasks could be "done quickly with the Switch's touchscreen control", which can only be used when the console is in handheld mode. He noted that many of the game's tasks are difficult to complete using a gamepad, which is required when the console is connected to a larger screen, and considered this version "inferior" to the PC and mobile versions.[134] He also stated that the communication system is "frustrating", as using the joystick to select letters is "slow", and said the fact that the game has support for multiplayer across multiple platforms gives Switch players "immediate disadvantage".[134] PJ O'Reilly of Nintendo Life noted that the Switch lacked much of the additional content available on other platforms, such as skins, which he called a "shame".[126]

Among Us has been frequently compared to Fall Guys, as both became popular as party games during the COVID-19 pandemic;[38][29][63] the developers of both games have positively acknowledged each other on Twitter.[135][136] Comparisons have also been drawn between the two games' avatars, which have been said to look like jelly beans.[137][138] Among Us has also been compared to The Thing,[25][139] Town of Salem,[35][139] Werewolves Within,[35] and Secret Hitler.[35]

Sales
As of September 2020, Steam Spy estimated that the game had more than 10 million owners on Steam.[140] The Associated Press noted the game was the most downloaded app on the iOS App Store for both iPhones and iPads in October 2020.[141] According to SuperData Research, the game had roughly 500 million players worldwide as of November 2020, with the free-to-play mobile version accounting for 97% of players and the buy-to-play PC version accounting for 3% of players, though it was the buy-to-play PC version that generated 64% of the game's gross revenue.[142] Among Us became one of the best selling games of 2020 on Steam, being listed on the platinum category on "The Year's Top 100" list.[143][144] The Nintendo Switch version's launch sold 3.2 million digital units in December 2020, making it the highest-earning version of the game for the month and one of the best-selling games on the Nintendo Switch.[145][146]

Among Us was offered as a free game on the Epic Games Store during one week in May 2021. Its average daily player count jumped from around 350,000 players in the weeks before to over 2 million players during the giveaway.[147] On June 29, 2021, Innersloth reported on Twitter that during the game's free promotion on Epic Games Store, at least 15 million copies were claimed.[148]

Legacy
Among Us has done collaborations and cross-overs with other games and studios. The first game they collaborated with was Fall Guys, who added Among Us-themed skins to their game.[162] Characters from Among Us have made cameos in the indie games Astroneer,[163] Sunshine Heavy Industries[164] and Samurai Gunn 2,[165] and Among Us is referenced in several stickers in the game A Hat in Time.[166] Several Among Us-themed cards are included in The Binding of Isaac: Four Souls Requiem.[167]

Themed skins and cosmetics from other games and properties have been added to Among Us as well: Innersloth and Riot Games crossed-over to bring Arcane themed cosmetics to Among Us.[168] In addition to that Innersloth has also done crossovers with Halo,[169] Ratchet & Clank,[170] and the movie franchise Scream.[171]

Outside of the game itself Innersloth has collaborated with BT21.[172] Among Us-themed posters were used to advertise the movie Free Guy,[173] and the "ejected" animation was referenced in the season 2 trailer for the animated series Snoopy in Space.[174]

Epic Games featured a community-created game mode in Fortnite Creative in December 2020 called "The Spy Within", which had very similar mechanics to Among Us, in which among ten players, the others have to complete tasks to earn enough coins within a limited time while trying to deduce which two players are trying to sabotage that effort.[175] Epic later added another (official and internally-developed) limited mode to Fortnite called "Impostors" in August 2021, which was recognized as even a closer take on Among Us, as the same basic mechanics as "The Spy Within" were used, but now taking place within an underground bunker with a layout similar to the Among Us map. Innersloth responded in frustration to this mode, which gave no credit to Innersloth. Innersloth's co-founder Marcus Bromander stated "Is it really that hard to put 10% more effort into putting your own spin on it though?", while studio representative Callum Underwood said that Innersloth was open to collaborations, "Just ask and if you follow some basic rules it’s usually fine".[176] In an October 2021 blog posting, Epic Games did credit Innersloth and Among Us as inspirations for the "Impostors" mode.[177]
