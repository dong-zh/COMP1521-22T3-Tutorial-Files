# Sarcasm 2, Electric Boogaloo

Hong Duang has now graduated from being a Twitter troll and now spends his days posting on Reddit. With the 280 character limit lifted, he now writes thousand word essays in text files that he wishes to sarcasise.

Write a C program that reads in an entire file and writes the sarcasised output into another file. The program should take 2 command line arguments: the input filename and the output filename.

```bash
./sarcasise2 essay.txt sarcasised.txt
```

Create the output file if it doesn't exist, and overwrite it if it does. The program do basic error handling.
