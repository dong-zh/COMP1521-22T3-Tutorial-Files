# Question 3

## Write MIPS directives to represent the following C variables (if you were asked to put them in the data segment)

## `int u`

```mips
.space 4
```

## `int v = 42`

```mips
.word 42
```

## `char w`

```mips
.space 1
```

## `char x = 'a'`

```mips
.byte 'a'
```

## `double y`

```mips
.align 3 # If there was a single byte directly above, you'd need to do an align otherwise you'll get an alignment error when loading/storing the double
.space 8
```

## `int z[20]`

```mips
.space 4 * 20
```
