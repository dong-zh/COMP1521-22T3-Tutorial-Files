# Concurrency vs Parallelism

## Concurrency

- A general concept that refers to having multiple tasks make progress without waiting for the previous to completely finish
- A single CPU (core) can be concurrent
  - It can run multiple processes or threads concurrently by swapping between them very quickly
  - A single CPU doesn't have parallelism (unless there's some multi-data magic going on)
- For example, using only 1 arm, you can write an essay and draw a picture concurrently, but not in parallel
  - You're able to stop drawing halfway, and then switch to writing the essay
  - You can't do both at the same time since you only can only use 1 arm
  - If I switch between them fast enough, it looks like I'm doing both at the 'same time', but in reality, I'm ever writing the essay or drawing the picture at any particular point in time
  - If I didn't have concurrency, I would have to completely finish my essay or drawing my picture before starting the other

## Parallelism

- Parallelism is a specific case of concurrency
  - E.g. if you can do 2 things at the same, then obviously, you're doing the second thing without waiting for the first thing to finish
- An example of a parallel system is a multi CPU (core) computer
- Continuing with our arm example, if I had 2 arms (and a super brain), theoretically, I can write an essay with my right arm, and draw a picture with my left arm at the same time
